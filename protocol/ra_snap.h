/*
  Memory-snapshot layout for the RetroAchievements-on-hardware protocol.
  See PROTOCOL.md for the wire format. This header defines the binary
  shape of one snapshot; both the console-side agent and the PC client
  keep a matching copy of this file.

  A snapshot is a fixed header followed by the watched values, packed
  back to back in watch-list order. Addresses are not sent: the client
  generated the watch list and knows the order.

  Tear protection: the sequence number seq is repeated in a trailer word
  placed AFTER the values (RA_SNAP_TRAILER_OFF). A reader that assembles
  the snapshot from a shared buffer reads seq from the header, copies the
  values, then checks the trailer against the header; a mismatch means
  the snapshot was overwritten mid-copy and should be skipped. The
  seq_end field in the header cannot detect this on its own, since it is
  written before the values.
